# T-rex_bot
Automation of chrome t-rex game using PyAutoGui. 
The code is optimized for 1366x768 resolution and works on http://www.trex-game.skipser.com/. 
Anyone with decent coding skills can easily calibrate the above bot for similar games running on any screen size by scaling a few variables. 
It's not some AI bot running using a convolution neural network. It's a simple beginner-friendly code written within 100 lines. Don't expect freaking amazing results.
